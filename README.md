This is a game I made to learn how the P5 engine works, and to practice JS.<br>
It is fairly simple but will work online as a single-player game.<br>
To do:<ul>
<li>Make AI to play against (random then matchbox)</li>
<li>Make choice for local 2 player vs AI</li>
<li>Make piece falling animation</li>
<li>Improve/redesign UI</li>
<li>Add arrows, numbers per column</li>
<li>Improve efficiency of checking - dont chdck past certain values</li>
<li>Make program detect a draw</li></ul>
